    <h4>2. Shipping Cost Based on Weight and Destination

        Problem:
        Write a program that calculates the shipping cost for a parcel based on its weight and destination:

        Weight <= 1kg: Local: $5 National: $8 International: $15 Weight> 1kg and <= 5kg: Local: $10 National: $15
                International: $30 Weight> 5kg and <= 10kg: Local: $20 National: $25 International: $50 Weight> 10kg:

                    Local: $30

                    National: $35

                    International: $70



                    Requirements:

                    Input: Two variables for weight and destination

                    Output: The total shipping cost
